AgBlogger is a markdown-first blogging platform where markdown files with YAML front matter are the source of truth for all post content and metadata. A lightweight relational database acts as a cache for search/filtering and stores user/auth data. Configuration lives in TOML files. A bidirectional sync mechanism keeps a local directory and the server in lockstep.

## Python requirements:
- Use strict typing with mypy
- Use type hints for function parameters and return types
- Use type aliases for complex types
- Use type annotations for variables and attributes

## Instructions
- Use the frontend-design skill to design the user interface and user experience.
- Ensure code is well-structured and follows best practices.
- Ensure strict typing.
- Write tests for all implemented features.
- Ensure tests pass before moving on to the next phase.
- Ensure the application works end-to-end. Use the playwright mcp to test in the browser.
