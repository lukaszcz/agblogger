Your task is to implement AgBlogger following PLAN.md. Update PLAN.md periodically to reflect progress and changes. After completing each phase, write tests and ensure they pass. Review the code after each phase to ensure it meets the requirements and is well-structured. Use /code-review to review the code after each phase. When a phase is completed, stage the changes, create a commit, and move on to the next phase.

Use the frontend-design skill to design the user interface and user experience.

## Python requirements:
- Use strict typing with mypy
- Use type hints for function parameters and return types
- Use docstrings for functions and classes
- Use type aliases for complex types
- Use type annotations for variables and attributes

## Completion criteria:
- Implement all required features as specified in PLAN.md.
- Ensure code is well-structured and follows best practices.
- Ensure strict typing.
- Write tests for all implemented features.
- Ensure tests pass before moving on to the next phase.
- Ensure the application works end-to-end. Use the playwright mcp to test in the browser.
