Perform a thorough review of the test suite. Evaluate the general robustness and thoroughness of the test suite, as well as the following concrete aspects.
- Do the tests actually make meaningful non-trivial assertions about the tested code?
- Are error paths tested in addition to success paths?
- Are all edge cases covered?
- Are complex user workflows tested?
- Do property-based tests cover non-trivial semantic invariants?
