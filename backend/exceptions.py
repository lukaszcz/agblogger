"""Application-level exception types.

Convention:
- ``InternalServerError`` — for errors whose details must never reach clients
  (decryption failures, config validation, infrastructure port conflicts, etc.).
  The global handler logs the full message at ERROR and returns a generic
  "Internal server error" (500) to the client.
- ``ValueError`` — for *business logic* validation errors that are safe to
  forward to clients (invalid dates, bad input formats, etc.).  The global
  ``ValueError`` handler returns ``str(exc)`` as the 422 detail.
